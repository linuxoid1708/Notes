# AutoRuns

Windows can be configured to run commands at startup, with elevated privileges.
These "AutoRuns" are configured in the Registry.

If you are able to write to an AutoRun executable, and are able to restart the system ( or wait for it to be restarted ) you may be able to escalate privileges.
